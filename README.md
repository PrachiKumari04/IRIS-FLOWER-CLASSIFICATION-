Iris Flower Classification

Overview:
This project uses machine learning to classify Iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Dataset:
The Iris dataset is a classic multiclass classification problem, widely used in machine learning and data science. It consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers, with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).

Model: 
This project uses Logistic Regression as the classification model. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.

Features:
- Data loading and preparation
- Feature exploration (optional)
- Data splitting into training and testing sets
- Model selection and training (Logistic Regression)
- Prediction and evaluation (accuracy and classification report)
- Visualization of feature distribution (petal length)
- Confusion matrix for better result interpretation

Usage:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, numpy)
3. Run the code 

Results:
- Accuracy: 97%
- Classification report:
    - Precision: 0.97
    - Recall: 0.97
    - F1-score: 0.97
- Confusion matrix:

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning for classification tasks, specifically with the Iris dataset. The Logistic Regression model achieves high accuracy and provides insights into the importance of feature selection.
